# parkservice

This is a project where the script combines all of the volunteer hours to find the top volunteer to receive special edition park badge. 

The Park Service has just inherited two parks: Wolf Point Park and Raccoon Meadows. Each park has a volunteer program where volunteers help maintain the parks by cleaning campsites, planning educational events, and maintaining hiking trails.

You’ll need to take your colleague’s code, combine data from both park’s volunteer logs, then calculate which volunteers have the most hours. Get your bug spray and hiking boots and let’s type out this program!

#Result 

To see the result in a console.log(), call .sort(byHours) on result.
Save your code. Then in the terminal, run tsc to compile your code and node index.js to see the top volunteers.

Already typed in at the bottom of index.ts: console.log(result.sort(byHours));
